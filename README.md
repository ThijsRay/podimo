# Podimo to RSS

Podimo is a proprietary podcasting player that enables you to listen to various exclusive shows behind a paywall.
This tool allows you to stream Podimo podcasts with your preferred podcast player, without having to use the Podimo app.

</div>

## Usage

The easiest way to use it is via [podimo.thijs.sh](https://podimo.thijs.sh). You can also host it yourself by following the instructions below. It's necessary to create a ScraperAPI account to bypass Podimo's anti-bot mechanisms.

## Setting up a ScraperAPI account

You can create a free account, which gives you 1000 free API credits per month.

1. Go to [dashboard.scraperapi.com/signup](https://dashboard.scraperapi.com/signup) and create a free account
2. Copy your API key and make sure to add it to the `SCRAPER_API` environment variable (`-e`) in the Docker run command

## Instructions for self-hosting (with Docker)

1. Clone this repository and enter the newly created directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ThijsRay/podimo
cd podimo
```

2. Build the Docker image

```sh
docker build -t podimo:latest .
```

3. Run the Docker image

```sh
docker run --rm -e PODIMO_HOSTNAME=yourip:12104 -e PODIMO_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0:12104 -e PODIMO_PROTOCOL=http -e SCRAPER_API=APIKEY -p 12104:12104 podimo:latest
```

For an explaination of what each environmental variable (`-e`) does, see the section on [configuration with environmental variables](#configuration).

4. Visit http://yourip:12104. You should see the site now!

## Installation for self-hosting (without Docker)

Make sure you have a recent Python 3 version installed, as this is required for the steps below.

1. Clone this repository and enter the newly created directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ThijsRay/podimo
cd podimo
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to install the Python packages in

```sh
vitualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages with

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the program with

```sh
python main.py
```

4. Visit http://localhost:12104. You should see the site now!

## Configuration

There are a few environmental variables that can configure this tool

- `PODIMO_HOSTNAME` Sets the hostname that is displayed in the interface to a custom value, defaults to `podimo.thijs.sh`
- `PODIMO_BIND_HOST` Sets the IP and port to which this tool should bind, defaults to `127.0.0.1:12104`.
- `PODIMO_PROTOCOL` Sets the protocol that is displayed in the interface. For local
  deployments it can be useful to set this to `http`. Defaults to `https`.
- `ZENROWS_API` Sets the Zenrows API key for it to be used.
- `DEBUG` Shows a bit more information that can be useful while debugging
- `HTTP_PROXY` A URL for an HTTP proxy that can be used to rotate IP addresses to avoid being blocked by CloudFlare.

Other configuration values can be found in `podimo/config.py`, but they generally don't have to be changed.

## Privacy

The script keeps track of a few things in memory:

- Your username and password, used to login and to create an access token. This is only used temporarily during a request itself.
- A cryptographic hash that is calculated based on your username and password.
- A Podimo access token, which is kept in memory for accessing pages after logging in.

This data is _never_ written to the disk and it is _never_ logged. The hosted script on [podimo.thijs.sh](https://podimo.thijs.sh) runs behind an `nginx` reverse proxy that requires HTTPS and does not keep any logs. The `nginx` configuration is:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=podimo_limit:10m rate=1r/s;
server {
	server_name podimo.thijs.sh;
	access_log off;
	error_log   /dev/null   crit;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:12104;

		limit_req zone=podimo_limit burst=5;
		limit_req_status 429;

		add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000;" always;

		add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=300";
		add_header X-Accel-Buffering no;
		proxy_buffering off;

		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	}

	listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;
	listen 443 ssl;
	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/podimo.thijs.sh/fullchain.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/podimo.thijs.sh/privkey.pem;
	include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
	ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
}


server {
	if ($host = podimo.thijs.sh) {
		return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
	}

	access_log off;
	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	server_name podimo.thijs.sh;
	return 404;
}
```
