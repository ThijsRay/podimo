# Podimo to RSS

Podimo is a proprietary podcasting player that enables you to listen to various exclusive shows behind a paywall.
This tool allows you to stream Podimo podcasts with your preferred podcast player, without having to use the Podimo app.

## Environment variables

* **BIND_HOST**: Sets the host and port to bind on (default: 0.0.0.0:12104)
* **HOST**: Host that will be displayed in the example. (default: podimo.thijs.sh)

## Usage
You can see an example on [podimo.thijs.sh](https://podimo.thijs.sh).

### Usage if your player doesn't support HTTP Authentication
To obtain a Podimo RSS feed, you need to provide
* Your Podimo username
* Your Podimo password
* The ID of the podcast you want to listen to

These values are passed via an URL.
#### Example
* **Username** `example@example.com`
* **Password** `this-is-my-password`
* **Podcast ID** `12345-abcdef`

The URL will be
`https://podimo.thijs.sh/feed/example%40example.com/this-is-my-password/12345-abcdef.xml`. You can pass this URL directly to your favorite podcast player that supports RSS feeds.

Please be aware that this older method might leak your credentials when you use them in your podcast player, as your player is not aware that there are credentials in the URL. The recommended way is the tool is to use the form on [podimo.thijs.sh](https://podimo.thijs.sh) or your own self-hosted instance. This uses HTTP Authentication, which treats your credentials as sensitive information. Podcast players will not share these credentials.

## Installation for self-hosting
If you want run this script yourself, you need a recent Python 3 version and install the packages in `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Installation for Docker Compose (self-built image)
If you want to run this script yourself in a Docker container (using Docker Compose), follow the following steps: 

### Step 1  - download copy of this respository
Go to the directory where you want your local copy, e.g. `cd /home/user/`.

Then, pull this repository.
`git clone https://github.com/ThijsRay/podimo.git`
This will download the entire script and all files to a new directory, e.g. /home/user/podimo.

### Step 2  - create a Docker Compose file:
Go to the directory where you want your docker-compose.yml file to live, e.g. `cd /opt/docker`.

Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:
```
version: "3"
services:
	podimo:
		build: 
		context: /home/user/podimo  # Directory from step 1
		dockerfile: Dockerfile
		container_name: podimo
		environment:
			- HOST=[your_domain]  # Default: podimo.thijs.sh
			- BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0:12104
		ports:
			- 12104:12104
		restart: unless-stopped
```

### Step 3  - Build the image and start the Docker container with the script:
First build the image: `docker compose build`, then start it up: `docker compose up -d` 

To check if the container is running: `docker compose logs -f podimo` 

If the container is running correctly, it will report something like this: `[2023-08-08 22:09:05 +0200] [7] [INFO] Running on http://0.0.0.0:12104 (CTRL + C to quit)`


## Privacy
The script keeps track of a few things in memory:
- Your username and password, used to login and to create an access token. This is only used temporarily during a request itself.
- A cryptographic hash that is calculated based on your username and password.
- A Podimo access token, which is kept in memory for accessing pages after logging in.

This data is _never_ written to the disk and it is _never_ logged. The hosted script runs behind an `nginx` reverse proxy that requires HTTPS and does not keep any logs. The `nginx` configuration is:
```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=podimo_limit:10m rate=1r/s;
server {
	server_name podimo.thijs.sh;
	access_log off;
	error_log   /dev/null   crit;

	location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:12104;

	  limit_req zone=podimo_limit burst=5;
	  limit_req_status 429;

	  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000;" always;
	  add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=300";
	  add_header X-Accel-Buffering no;

	  proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	}
