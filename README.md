## Bot detection
Depending on your usage patterns, it might be necessary to bypass Podimo's anti-bot mechanisms.
This can be done through a Zenrows, ScraperAPI or a generic HTTP proxy.

### Setting up a Zenrows account
You can create a free trial account for Zenrows

1. Go to [app.zenrows.com/register](https://app.zenrows.com/register) and create a free account
2. Copy your API key and make sure to add it to the `ZENROWS_API` environment variable

### Setting up a ScraperAPI account
You can create a free trial account for ScraperAPI

1. Go to [dashboard.scraperapi.com/signup](https://dashboard.scraperapi.com/signup) and create a free account
2. Copy your API key and make sure to add it to the `SCRAPER_API` environment variable

## Privacy
The script keeps track of a few things in memory:
- Your username and password, used to login and to create an access token. This is only used temporarily during a request itself.
- A cryptographic hash that is calculated based on your username and password.
- A Podimo access token, which is kept in memory for accessing pages after logging in.

This data is not written to the disk (unless `STORE_TOKENS_ON_DISK` is set to true) and it is _never_ logged.
